  "content": "<div class=\"lead-paragraph\"><p>The world of work has changed dramatically in recent years. Remote work, flexible arrangements, and the gig economy have transformed how people work and get paid. However, most payroll systems were designed for a 9-to-5 world where everyone works full-time for a single employer.</p></div><div class=\"highlight-box bg-payflo-purple/5 p-6 rounded-xl my-8\"><p class=\"text-lg\">At Payflo, we've built our payroll infrastructure from the ground up to support the modern workforce. Here's how we're addressing the challenges of modern work:</p></div><h2>Flexibility First</h2><div class=\"feature-box bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-sm border border-gray-100 my-8\"><p>Modern work requires flexible payment options. Our system supports various payment schedules, from traditional bi-weekly payroll to daily payouts for gig workers. We've designed our APIs to accommodate all kinds of work arrangements, ensuring that everyone gets paid accurately and on time.</p></div><h2>Multi-Entity Support</h2><div class=\"info-box bg-gradient-to-r from-payflo-purple/10 to-payflo-blue/10 p-8 rounded-xl my-8\"><p class=\"text-lg\">Many modern workers have multiple income sources. Our infrastructure makes it easy to manage payments across different entities, whether they're full-time employees, contractors, or hybrid workers.</p></div><h2>Real-Time Processing</h2><blockquote class=\"border-l-4 border-payflo-purple pl-6 my-8 italic\">In today's fast-paced world, waiting two weeks for a paycheck isn't always feasible. Our system supports real-time payment processing, allowing for on-demand payments when needed.</blockquote><h2>Compliance Across Borders</h2><div class=\"feature-box bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-sm border border-gray-100 my-8\"><p>Remote work means that employers and employees may be in different jurisdictions. Our compliance engine handles the complexity of multi-state and multi-country regulations, ensuring that payments are always compliant with local laws.</p></div><h2>Data Security</h2><div class=\"security-box bg-payflo-purple/5 p-6 rounded-xl my-8\"><div class=\"flex items-start\"><svg class=\"h-6 w-6 text-payflo-purple mt-1 mr-4 flex-shrink-0\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 256 256\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M208 80h-32V56a48 48 0 0 0-96 0v24H48a16 16 0 0 0-16 16v112a16 16 0 0 0 16 16h160a16 16 0 0 0 16-16V96a16 16 0 0 0-16-16ZM92 56a36 36 0 0 1 72 0v24H92Zm116 152H48V96h160v112Zm-76-68a12 12 0 1 1-12-12a12 12 0 0 1 12 12Z\"/></svg><p>With increased focus on data privacy and security, we've built our infrastructure with security at its core. We use bank-level encryption and adhere to strict compliance standards to protect sensitive information.</p></div></div><div class=\"info-box bg-gradient-to-r from-payflo-purple/10 to-payflo-blue/10 p-8 rounded-xl my-8\"><p class=\"text-lg\">By addressing these challenges, we're creating a payroll infrastructure that supports the way people work today and will work in the future.</p></div><div class=\"cta-section bg-white p-8 rounded-xl shadow-sm border border-gray-100 my-8\"><p class=\"mb-4\">If you're building tools for the modern workforce, we'd love to show you how Payflo can help you offer payroll capabilities to your customers.</p><div class=\"inline-block\"><a href=\"/book-demo\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Transforma  tu organizaci√≥n</a></div></div>",
